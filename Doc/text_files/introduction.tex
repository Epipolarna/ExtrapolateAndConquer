The aim of this project was to develop a computer graphics application combining several state-of-the-art techniques into a beautiful world.

During the project a general framework for building games/simulations was develeoped, using c++11 template programming to provide an easily used entity-architecture to manage ingame objects. A rendering system cabable of handling large amount of objects without any direct optimizations was also developed alongside the entity-system. The rendering system can manage rendering of large numbers of objects, as well as high quality realtime shadows cast by objects and terrain. A rudimentary world generator based on simplex noise for the terrain generation, and rejection sampling based growth placement.


The project was performed as a part of the course TSBK03 - Techniques for advanced computer games. The code is written in C++11 and GLSL version 150. We use Qt 5.1 as OpenGL wrapper and context provider and OpenCV for some mathematical operations and filtering.
