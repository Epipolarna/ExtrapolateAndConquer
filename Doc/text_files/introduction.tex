The aim of this project was to develop a computer graphics application combining several state-of-the-art techniques into a beautiful world.

TODO: List of what we have done? (e.g. det som var på sliden som vi började vår presentation med.)?


The project was performed as a part of the course TSBK03 - Techniques for advanced computer games. The code is written in C++11 and GLSL (version?!). We use Qt 5.1 as OpenGL wrapper and context provider and OpenCV for some mathematical operations and filtering.
